.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
calculates how many bytes of SMS payload are required for the given input text.
.Pp
The algorithm first attempts to encode the input using GSM 03.38, which requires
seven or 14 bits per character (depending on whether the character is an ``extension'' character).
However only certain commonly-used characters are encodable in GSM 03.38,
so if any unsupported characters are seen, the algorithm reverts to UTF-16 encoding
for the entire message, thus requiring 16 bits per character.
.Pp
The first form prints the number of bytes required to encode the input.
.Pp
The
.Fl r
form inverts the calcaulation, printing the number of input bytes that
will fit under the given encoded length
.Ar limit .
The SMS payload limit is 140 bytes, so for example
.Fl r Ar 140
will calculate how much of the input text can fit in a single SMS message.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
form performs the same calculation as the
.Fl r
form but copies the input to the output, truncating it when the calculated
.Ar limit
number of encoded output bytes is reached.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Specify input character encoding.
By default, UTF-8 is assumed.
.It Fl r Ar limit
Output the number of input bytes that, when encoded in an SMS payload,
will have a length at most
.Ar limit .
.It Fl t Ar limit
Copy the input to the output up until the encoded length would reach
.Ar limit .
.It Fl h
Output usage message and exit.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits zero normally, or 1 if an error occurs.
.Pp
Possible errors include an invalid byte sequence in the input.
